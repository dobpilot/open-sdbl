## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Provide an interactive PostgreSQL REPL
The `open-sdbl-cli` package SHALL provide `open-sdbl console postgres` using
the existing connection and authentication options, with `repl` retained as a
compatibility alias. It SHALL load metadata at startup, accept
semicolon-terminated multiline UTF-8 queries, provide current-session command
history on interactive terminals, protect interactive Linux terminal editing
with `IUTF8`, recover from a byte-invalid input line, and execute every
generated statement in a verified read-only `READ COMMITTED` transaction.

#### Scenario: Interactive command hint
- **WHEN** the console displays a top-level interactive prompt
- **THEN** a compact hint for `\dt`, `\di`, `\d`, `\refresh`, `\help`, and
  `\q` is visible adjacent to that prompt

#### Scenario: Recall query history
- **WHEN** the user presses Up or Down in an interactive console
- **THEN** the line editor navigates queries and commands entered earlier in
  the current console session

#### Scenario: Query execution
- **WHEN** the user enters a supported 1C query terminated by `;`
- **THEN** the CLI displays SDBL-to-SQL generation time, exact generated SQL,
  PostgreSQL execution time, column labels, rows, and row count and then
  prompts for the next command

#### Scenario: Recoverable error
- **WHEN** compilation or PostgreSQL execution fails
- **THEN** the console prints the error and elapsed phase time, rolls back the
  statement transaction, and remains available

#### Scenario: Recoverable byte-invalid input
- **WHEN** one input line is not valid UTF-8
- **THEN** the console discards the affected statement, reports the input
  error, and accepts the next command without closing the database connection

#### Scenario: UTF-8 terminal editing
- **WHEN** the console runs on an interactive Linux terminal with `IUTF8`
  disabled
- **THEN** it enables `IUTF8` while reading commands and restores the previous
  terminal attributes before exit

#### Scenario: Session lifecycle
- **WHEN** input reaches EOF or the user enters `\q`
- **THEN** the CLI closes the PostgreSQL connection and exits successfully
